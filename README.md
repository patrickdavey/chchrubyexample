ChChRuby Sample Rails App
=========================


===Windows===

1. Go to [http://railsinstaller.org/en](http://railsinstaller.org/en) and download and install the program for windows.
2. Once you are through the install process, you should have a folder which looks like the following:
  ![Setup Folder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/patrickdavey/chchrubyexample/master/doc/start_icons.png)
3. After that, you can click on the 'interactive ruby' link and play around with ruby.

===Further Installation===

In order to get colours working on Windows, you can follow the instructions here: [http://softkube.com/blog/ansi-command-line-colors-under-windows](http://softkube.com/blog/ansi-command-line-colors-under-windows)

It is important that the x64 / x32 directory is extracted to c:/ansicon . Then run the installer as an administrator.  This isn't guaranteed to work but in our limited testing it has.
